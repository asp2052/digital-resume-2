I'm Addison Pigg, an electrical engineering student at Mississippi State University. I am a telecommunications intern at TVA and have been there for almost two years. I have picked up skills in routers, switches, modums, and other equipment used for telecommunications in the substation. I will start full time at TVA in May as a telecom system field operations engineer.
